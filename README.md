# Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Rental Agency ("CCBBRA")

## Summary

[CCBBRA](https://ckinleydavis.github.io/ccbbra/) was developed by Nicholas Herold, Ahmad Kane and Carla Kinley-Davis in 2021 during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The application is meant to address the needs of the traveler who is looking for a rental car during the current vehicle shortage due to months of economic shutdown.
